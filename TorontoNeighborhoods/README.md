# Toronto Neighborhoods Clustering

### Please, note that Pangodream is the name of my repository (Alberto Iriberri). So if you see the link I submitted belongs to Pangodream, the reason is that I was already using a Github account for my daily work.

### I wasn't able to get coodinates from Geocoder, Nominatim or the link https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data so I decided to create my own CSV file and upload it to the repository.
